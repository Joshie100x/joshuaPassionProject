      <h1>How Drawing Has Influenced My Life</h1>
      <p>
          I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. Since the age of 2 I have been trying to replicate images and people that I saw. Sounds crazy I know, 
          but I assure you that it is the case. I was introduced to drawing through my Father who was an architect and worked on project development in the city 
          of Detroit. He was also very interested in comics and japanese cartoons growing up and would watch them with me and my brothers. Growing up, my Dad was 
          my hero, and I wanted to be just like him; thus, my interest in drawing festered, and I began trying to replicate what he did. 
      </p>
      <p>
          One day, my Dad showed me a comic book that he was reading and it changed my life forever. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a comic book that 
          became the best selling comic book of all time, selling an amazing 8 million copies. This comic was X-Men #1, and looking at that book as a child sparked
          a fire within me that still burns to this day. To say that I was mesmerized by it would be an understatement. I wanted to be the characters in the book.
          I saw a character named Cyclops and wanted to be him. After I understood that was not possible, I settled for creating the stories. From that point on, 
          I knew that one day I wanted to create these characters and shape their fates just as the artist who drew that book did. That artist's name was Jim Lee, 
          and he remains a huge influence on me to this day.
